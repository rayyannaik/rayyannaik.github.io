        <h1 id="projectTitle">3D Fan Blade Modelling</h1>

        <p>This project focuses on creating a detailed 3D fan blade using AutoCAD. It helped me practice surface
            modeling techniques and study how curvature and rotation affect the final design.
        </p>

        <h4 id="projectTitle">About Project</h4>

        <p>I began by drawing the central hub and shaping one blade using curved profiles. After getting the right
            shape, I used the array tool to repeat the blade evenly around the axis. Adjusting the blade angle and
            thickness took a few tries until the model looked balanced and realistic.</p>

        <p>
            The finished design shows smooth surfaces, correct spacing, and symmetry among all the blades. I also
            rendered the model to highlight the lighting and reflections, which makes the form easier to visualize.
        </p>

        <p>The final outcome was a production-ready model with detailed documentation. Through this project, I learned
            how to create symmetrical parts, handle curved geometry, and maintain proportion while modeling in 3D.</p>
